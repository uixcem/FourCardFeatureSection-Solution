### What I learned

While this project appeared simple at first glance, it presented some interesting challenges that helped me enhance my CSS skills. Here are some key learnings:

- Improved my understanding of CSS Grid for creating responsive layouts, particularly in the nutrition section
- Learned to effectively implement custom fonts using @font-face:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Young Serif";
  src: url("/assets/fonts/young-serif/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: normal;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
```

- Practiced creating clean, maintainable CSS using custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #f3e5d8;
  --mainCard-bg-color: #fff;
  --sectionFirst-bg-color: #fff7fc;
  /* other variables */
}
```

- Enhanced my skills in responsive design and mobile optimization
